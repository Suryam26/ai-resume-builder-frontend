# React + Vite Application

This is a basic setup for a React application using Vite as the build tool. Vite provides a fast development environment and optimizes the build process for React applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.0.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6.0.0 or later) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 1.22.0 or later)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the React + Vite application:

### 1. Create a New Vite Project

You can create a new Vite project using the following command:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
# OR
yarn create vite my-react-app --template react
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the Vite development server to run your React application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
```

This command will start the development server and open your React application in your default web browser. You can also manually navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### 5. Build the Application

To create an optimized production build of your React application, run:

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

The optimized build will be output to the `dist` directory.

### 6. Preview the Production Build

You can locally preview the production build using the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
# OR
yarn preview
```

This will serve the contents of the `dist` directory on a local server, allowing you to test your build before deploying.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project's structure:

```
my-react-app/

├── public/
│   └── vite.svg
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/

│   └── main.jsx
├── .gitignore
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── vite.config.js
└── yarn.lock
```

- `public/`: Static assets that will be served by Vite.
- `src/`: The source code of your React application.
    - `assets/`: Static assets used in your React components.
    - `components/`: React components.
    - `App.css`: Styles for the main `App` component.
    - `App.jsx`: The main `App` component.
    - `index.css`: Global styles.
    - `main.jsx`: The entry point for the React application.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `index.html`: The HTML template for the application.
- `package.json`: Lists dependencies and scripts.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration for Vite.
- `yarn.lock`: Lockfile for Yarn dependencies (if using Yarn).
